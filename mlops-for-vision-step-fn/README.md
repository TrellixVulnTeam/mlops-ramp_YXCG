## VISION model and Step Function

This senario performs model development using the Object Detection model of Yolov5 and then builds the MLOps architecture directly using AWS Step Functions from the customer's account. 
All implementations are directly done by the customer and the issues that arise during the course of the program are shared by the SAs in charge and supported by debugging.
