## MLOPS-RAMP

RAMP Program is a customer-centered workshop program in which customers directly configure MLOps for automating the model's seamless workflow with AWS' model development environment through the use of hands-on AWS services. RAMP allows customers to experience real-world trial-and-error experiences by using AWS' services themselves, thereby further enhancing their understanding of AWS' services. In addition, RAMP can be used as a base architecture for future customer actual workloads based on the architecture created in the customer's account.

In the MLOPS RAMP Program, as a Data Scientist, customers develop models in Amazon SageMaker, or you actually do methods of model inference, and in the role of Machine Learning Platform Engineer/MLOps Engineer, you implement the end-to-end workflow from data preparation to model distribution.
